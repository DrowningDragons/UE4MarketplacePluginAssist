# UE4MarketplacePluginAssist

*Works with UE5*

If you have a code plugin on the marketplace then you probably want this.

This is a C# Application that makes it easy to build, validate, and zip your plugins ready for distribution.

It executes RunUAT.bat to build and validate the plugin. It can do every engine version in one go and tell you the results. It can also zip your plugin ready for upload.

Feel free to check out the preview video here to understand what it does in detail: https://youtu.be/72rsRnzxNog
